OOP : 
a programming paradigm ( style of code, "how" we write and organize code ) based on the concepts of objects

we use object to model (describe) real-world or abstract features

Objects may contain data(properties) and code ( methods). by using objects, we pack data and the corresponding behaivor into one block 

In OOPS, Objects are self-contained piece/blocks of code

OOP was developed with the goal of organizing code, to make it more flexible and easier to maintain (avoid "spaghetti code")


Class : Like a blueprint from which we can create new objects
Fictional class :
User{
  user
  password
  email
  
  login(password){
     // login logic
  }

  sendMessage(str){
     // Sending logic
  }  
}



Now let's create an object using it : 

new User('jatin')

{
  user = 'jatin'
  password = 'abc123'
  email = 'js@abc.com'

   login(password){
     // login logic
  }

  sendMessage(str){
     // Sending logic
  }  
}


Now we can create as many instances as we want : 
------------------------------
new User('ram')

{
  user = 'ram'
  password = 'om_namah_shivay'
  email = 'ram@sita.com'

   login(password){
     // login logic
  }

  sendMessage(str){
     // Sending logic
  }  
}

-------------------------------
new User('dipu')

{
  user = 'dipu'
  password = 'dipu8372'
  email = 'dipu@abc.com'

   login(password){
     // login logic
  }

  sendMessage(str){
     // Sending logic
  }  
}





------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4 fundamental principles of OOPS : (aeip)
1. Abstaction
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism


Abstraction : hidding details that are not necessary to the user. addEventListener we don't know how things goes behind the scenes? No. do we care? No We dont' really!
Because the low level details of how exactly it works has been abstracted away from us, from the end user, we can simply use it, without knowing how it works BTS.
After this bend with the next fundamental --> encapsultaion


Encapsulation : Keeping properties and methods private inside the class, so they are not accessible from outside the class. Some methods can be exposed as a public interface (API)
We can either defined the access specifiers like private, public ,protected
not actually JS Code
User{
   user
   private password
   private email
  
   login(word){
      this.password === word
   }

   comment(text){
      this.checkSPAM(text)
   }
   private checkSPAM(text){
      // Verify logic
   }
}




Inheritance : Let say we have two classes : User & Administrator
 
User{
  user 
  password 
  email 

   login(password){
     // login logic
  }

  sendMessage(str){
     // Sending logic
  }  
}


Admin{
  user 
  password 
  email
  permission 

   login(password){
     // login logic
  }

  sendMessage(str){
     // Sending logic
  }  
  
  deleteUser(str){
     // Deleting logic
  }  
  
}


Now if we see, we will notice that they both have lot in common like user,password,email, login,sendMessage and if we think admin is also a user so admin also needs a password and an email and he also needs to login.
So if we design our classes like this, then we will end up with lot of duplicate code and we already know that's bad. That's where inheritance comes into play.
In OOPs when we have two closely related classes we can have one class inherit from the other. So we have one Parent Class and one Child Class	so ChildClass extends parentClass

making all properties and methods of a certain class available to a child class, forming a hierarchical relationship between classes. This allows us to reuse common logic and to model real-world relationship

The different thing are : permission data, deleteUser Method then can be added specifically in the child class (admin)






Polymorphism

A child class can overwrite a method it inherited from a parent class.

//Parent Class
User{
  user 
  password 
  email 

   login(password){
     // login logic
  }

  sendMessage(str){
     // Sending logic
  }  
}


// Child Class : 1
Admin{
  user 
  password 
  email
  permission 

   login(password,key){
     // Different Logic
  }
  
  deleteUser(str){
     // Deleting logic
  }  
  
}



// Child Class : 2
Author{
  user 
  password 
  email
  post

   login(password){
     // different logic
  }
  
  writePost(){
     // Writing logic
  }  
  
}


both Admin and Author has many things in common as an user so we have created an user class as an parent which has two child admin and author. We know that they will inherit each and every properties and methods from the user but as they have different ways of login , so we will overwrite the inherited login method by writing our own login method.




---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Javascript, there is something called prototypes and all objects in Javascript are linked to a certain prototype object.
So we say each object has a prototype and now here comes the magic.
Prototypes object contains methods and properties that all the objects that are linked to that prototype can access and use.
This behavior is ususally called prototypal inheritance, means that all objects linked to that prototype can access it properties and methods(behavior)


for example : Array in Js is linked to the Array.prototype and this prototype has all methods like map, filter, find, reduce....
and therefore Array as been a part of Array.prototype can use it
 


Q. how do we actually create prototypes? and how do we link objects to prototypes? how can we create new Objects, without having classes? 

1. Constructor functions
-> Technique to create objects from a function
-> this is how built-in objects like Array, Maps or Sets are actually implemented.

2.ES6 Classes
-> Modern alternative to constructor function syntax
-> Works exactly the same as constructor function

3. Object.create()
-> easiest and most straight forward



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Contructor Function

It's actually completely normal function. The only difference between a regular function and this function is that we call contructor function with the new operator.

Practical : 
Let's create a constructor function for a person and that will produce an object. Remember that here the naming convention is always capitalize and you can use function decalaration or expression but you can't go with arrow function because it does n't have their own this keyword

const Person = function(firstName,birthYear){
  console.log(this);
}

new Person('Jatin Sharma',2001);

// 1. New {} empty object is created
// 2. function is called, this = {} that newly empty object that we have created
// 3. {} linked to prototype
// 4. function automatically return {}

So right now we will get an empty Person Object : Person {}

Now we understand the logic so let's make an object :

const Person = function(fullName,BirthYear){
   console.log(this);
   this.fullName = fullName;
   this.birthYear = birthYear;
}

const jatin = new Person('Jatin Sharma',2001);

console.log(jatin) : Person{fullName:'Jatin Sharma',BirthYear:2001}

// What happens here is : 
as we have used new keyword so an empty object will be created of Person class and this will target the function and it will be called, and inside the function we have made two properties - fullName & birthYear. and in the end that function automatically returns that object that we have created.
and this will returned to our variable "jatin"
Now we can create as many objects as we want as we have already set the class blueprint that will make only fullname and birthyear

const ramji = new Person('Ram chandra',1500)
const sitaji = new Person('janki',1500)

an Object created from a clas  is called instance now we haven't technically created a class because Javascript doesn't really have classes however we did create an object from a constructor function. 
so we can say that jatin, ramji and sitaji are instance of Person and the properties of the objects will be called as instance properties

We can check whether the object is an instance of a xyz class or not: 
console.log(jatin instanceof Person)  --> true

const jay = "Jay";
console.log(jay instanceof Person)  --> false


Done with Properties, What about methods?
you can done with same approach : 


const Person = function(fullName,BirthYear){
   console.log(this);
   this.fullName = fullName;
   this.birthYear = birthYear;
   
   // this is a bad practice
   this.calcage = function(){
       console.log( 2037-this.birthYear );
   }

NOTE :  never create a method in constructor function because imagine we creating 100s of objects so all will get the same method and this will create a lot of duplications. so to solve this problem we are going to use prototype & prototypes inheritance



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Prototypes
How does all this prototype and prototype inheritance work?

To know everything about the constructor function : 
className.prototype // this is an object 
// ƒ (fullName, birthYear)
// [[Prototype]]
// Object

now you can provide the method to that prototype

Person.prototype.calcAge = function(){
  console.log(2023-this.birthYear)
}

jatin.calcAge() //this is called prototype inheritance as we inherit the calcAge of Person prototype into jatin object

Any object always has access to the methods and properties from it's prototype. And the prototype of jatin, ramji and sitaji is Person.prototype

to know what methods and properties are there in an object : object.__proto__
console.log(jatin.__proto__);
o/P = {calcAge:f() , constructor : f(fullName,birthYear)}
as calcAge was inherited and fullName and birthYear properties came from the constructor

all thing that are written in Object.prototype.xyz are never written in constructor section in console

Person.prototype.species = 'Homo sapiens';


# to check whether the object has it own property or now (or) it's not written in constructor function

Person.prototype.species = "Homo Sapiens";
console.log(jatin.hasOwnProperty("fullName"));  --> true
console.log(jatin.hasOwnProperty("birthYear"));  --> true
console.log(jatin.hasOwnProperty("species"));   ---> false










#now to know the prototype of the object of the class we use : __proto__ :

console.log(jatin.__proto__) 
O/P : {calcAge:f,constructor:f}
▶calcAge:f()
  species:"Homo Sapiens"
▶constructor:f(fullName,birthYear)



#now to know the object prototype : the top of the prototype chain
console.log(jatin.__proto__.__proto__)

O/P : {constructor:f, __defineGetter__:f, hasOwnProperty:f, __lookupGetter__:f}
▶constructor:f Object()
▶hasOwnProperty:f hasOwnProperty()
▶isPrototypeof:f isPrototypeof()
...


#now let's make an array
const arr = [12,44,51,62,24,46,75];
console.log(arr.__proto__);

Output :[.......]
▶at:f at(),concat:f concat(), constructor:f Array(),copyWithin:f copyWithin(), entries : f entries(), every: f every(), map : f map() ...



# to create a new array Method that will give unique values
let arr = [2,4,2,4,5,3,5];
Array.prototype.unique = function(){
 return [...new Set(this)];
}

console.log(arr.unique) =>  [2,4,5,3]









-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Live Example

const Car = function(make,speed){
   this.make = make;
   this.speed = speed;
}

const bmw = new Car('BMW',120);
const mercedes = new Car('mercedes',150);

Car.prototype.accelerate = function(){
  this.speed += 10;
  console.log(`${this.make} is running at the speed of ${this.speed} km/hr`);
}

Car.prototype.brake = function(){
  this.speed -= 5;
  console.log(`${this.make} is running at the speed of ${this.speed} km/hr`);
}

bmw.accelerate()
bmw.accelerate()
bmw.accelerate()
bmw.brake()
bmw.accelerate()

O/P: 
bmw is running at the speed of 130 km/hr
bmw is running at the speed of 140 km/hr
bmw is running at the speed of 135 km/hr
bmw is running at the speed of 145 km/hr



Done with constructor
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


ES6 Classes : do the same thing but using a nicer and more modern syntax

instead of function write class

we have class declaration :
class PersonClass{
   // logic...
}


We have class experation too but class declaration kinda look like class
const PersonClass = class{
   // logic...
}


here we have a constructor function and it is called whenever you create an object of the class using new

class PersonClass{
   constructor(fullName,birthYear){
       this.fullName = fullName;
       this.birthYear = birthYear;
   }
}

const jessica = new PersonClass('Jessica Scott',1999);
console.log(jessica)


------------Done with properties-------------------

Let's start with methods --- simply write them outside the constructor 

class PersonClass{
   constructor(fullName,birthYear){
       this.fullName = fullName;
       this.birthYear = birthYear;
   }

   calcAge(){
       console.log(2023-this.birthYear)
   }
}


all these methods that we write in the class outside the constructor will be on the prototype of the objects and not on the objects themselves.
so it goes inside __proto__ and there you will see the calcAge


Benefit of using ES6 is you don't have to mess with the prototype of the object as you can simply use constructor for properties, and make the methods outside the constructor

you can also use prototype with this also:
PersonClass.prototype.greet = function(){
    console.log(`Hello ${this.fullName}`);
}

jessica.greet() --> hello jessica

Or you can write inside the class but but but
NOTE : don't use comma for separating the methods : 

class PersonClass{
   constructor(fullName,birthYear){
       this.fullName = fullName;
       this.birthYear = birthYear;
   }

   calcAge(){
       console.log(2023-this.birthYear)
   }

   greet(){
       console.log(`Hello ${this.fullName}`);
   } 
}



IMPORTANT : classes are not hoisted even they are class declaration. so functional declarations, remember are hoisted which means we can use them before declaration but classes can't

second is Classes are also first-class citizens, means we can pass them into functions and also returm them from functions as classes are just some special kind of functions behind the scenes 

third : the body of the class is always executed in strict mode (or) classes are executed in strict mode











-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Setters and Getters

Every object in the Javascript can have setter and getter properties

class jassica {
   constructor(name,year){
      this.name = name;
      this.year = year;	
   }

   get age(){
      return 2023-this.year;
   }
} 

work as an property and not like a method
jassica.age()   X
jassica.age     ✔️



class Animal {
  constructor(name) {
    this._name = name;
  }

  fly() {
    console.log("you can fly");
  }

  get name() {
    return this._name;
  }

  set name(updatedName) {
    this._name = updatedName;
  }
}

const dog = new Animal("Bruno");
console.log(dog.name);    -----> Bruno
dog.name = "BruYES";
console.log(dog.name);    -----> BruYES



---------------------------------------------------------
#static methods
to make any static method in class 
add static keyword before the method name:

class Example{
   constructor(name){
       this.name = name; 
   }

   static hey(){
       console.log('hello sir');
   }
}


Static methods are used to implement functions that belong to a class as a whole and not to any particular object

 

class Animal{
   constructor(name){
     this.name = Animal.capitalize(name);
   }
   walk(){
     alert(`Animal ${this.name} is walking!!`);
   }

   static capitalize(name){
     return name.charAt[0].toUpperCase() + name.substr(1);   
   }
}

const dog = new Animal('bruno');
const cat = new Animal('Jackie');
dog.walk()  --> Animal Bruno is walking!!
cat.walk()  --> Animal Jackie is walking!!


Capitalize is only linked with the class and not with class object
like 
console.log(Animal.capitalize("bruno"));  --> Bruno
console.log(dog.capitalize("bruno")); -------> Error TypeError not a function






----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Inheritance between Classes : Constructor function
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

const Personclass = function (firstName, birthYear) {
  this.firstName = firstName;
  this.birthYear = birthYear;
};

Personclass.prototype.calcAge = function () {
  console.log(`Age of ${this.firstName} : ${2023 - this.birthYear}`);
};

const Studentclass = function (firstName, birthYear, course) {
  // this.firstName = firstName;
  // this.birthYear = birthYear;
  Personclass.call(this, firstName, birthYear); // hack to use different class inside different class, call() takes first argument of the object you want to assign the this keyword in our case it's Personclass and then we can pass the values as an argument and (this = Studentclass)
  this.course = course;
};

Studentclass.prototype.introduce = function () {
  console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.firstName} and I study ${this.course}`);
};

const j3 = new Studentclass("jatin", 2001, "Computer Science");
// console.log(j3);
j3.introduce();



//To use the prototype of Class Personclass inside the object of the class Studentclass
Note : link both the prototypes and then it will assign an empty prototypes in both then you add all the students prototype because if you do it before then they will get overwrite or you can't use them. So first link, then it will create empty prototypes and then assign the exteneded methods on the child and now you can good to use the methods of parent into the class  
-----------------

let refactor the code so that we can use the calcAge method of parent class i.e Personclass in child class i.e Studentclass
--------
Note: This is a mistake, assigning a method to the child class prototype before and then reassigning it to the Parent class prototype, here all the prototype of parent will be taken by child but it will remove this introduce method of child too.
--------
Studentclass.prototype.introduce = function () {
  console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.firstName} and I study ${this.course}`);
};

Studentclass.prototype = Personclass.prototype;


----------
Complete Right Code
----------

const Person = function(name,year){
   this.name=name;
   this.year=year;
}

Person.prototype.calcAge = function(){
   console.log(`Years old : ${2023-this.year}`);
}

const Student = function(name,year,course){
   Person.call(this,name,year);
   this.course = course;
}

Student.prototype = Person.prototype; 
(OR)
Student.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype);

Student.prototype.introduce = function(){
   console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I study ${this.course}`);
} 

const jatin = new Student('jatin',2001,'Computer Science');
jatin.introduce();
jatin.calcAge


//////////Done with using method of parent in child class, by constuctor function




----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Using method of parent in child class, by now using ES6 classes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

class Person{
   constructor(name,year){ 
	this.name = name;
  	this.year = year;
   }

   calcAge(){
 	console.log(`Years old : ${2023-this.year}`);	
   }

   static greet(){
	console.log(`good morning ${this.name}`)
   }
}

const p = new Person('paresh',2000);
Person.greet() --> good morning Person // because this = Person and this.name = Person, its a property of this and not the property of it Person Class. os if this.name inside the constructor is changed to names it will still give us the "good morning Person";


Note : to implement inheritance between ES6 classes, we only need two ingredients : super function and extends keyword
So to make the student class inherit from the person class, all we need to do is to say extends	:

class Student extends <ParentClass> {

}

so this will link the prototypes of both BTS without us even having to think about that : 
Note :  super(arg1,arg2..)in child class  = parent constructor have same arguments in both child and parent class. and super should be written first because this call to the super function is responsible for creating the "this" keyword in this subclass as without it you won't be able to use this keyword inside the subclass and can't do "course = this.course" 


class Student extends Person{
	constructor(name,year,course){  
  		//you don't have to use <Parent>.call(this,name,year); 
		// as we have super function for that as super is basically the constructor function of the parent class
		super(name,year)  

 	}
}
